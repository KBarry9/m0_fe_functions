# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I know my note taking is taking a lot of time, but I really need my notes and I'm not sure how to shorten that time right now. Maybe as I get more comfortable I will develop a shorthand.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function tells you the directions, like how you make a PB$J, but you still have to do another command to make the sandwich.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

Arguments and parameters have to be the same amount (1 argument, 1 parameter) and the parameter gives you variable that can change while the parameter fills in a precise answer to the the variable (genre, horror).
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I think these are fairly straight forward, the if statements make it harder. I think I just need more learning on the for statements and conditionals.
