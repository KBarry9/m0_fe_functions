// Each example below has at least one opportunity for improvement.

// YOUR TASK:
  // Modify the code to make that improvement(s)
  // write a JS comment to explain what you changed, and why
  // make sure the code you submit WORKS - you can run this entire file
    // using `node cleanUp.js` or copy and paste into a replit


// EX 1:
function nameQuestion() {
  console.log("Hello, what is your name?");
}

nameQuestion();
// I added semi colons after the parantheses on line 12 and line 15 to follow the format.

// EX 2:
function addThreeNums(first, second, third) {
  var sum = first + second + third;
  console.log(sum);
}

addThreeNums(1, 2, 3);
addThreeNums(4, 2, 7);
// I tabbed over line 20 and 21, added a semi colon to line 20, and moved the curly brace in line 22 forward to fit the format.

// EX 3:
function makeFreshPesto() {
  console.log("Buy ingredients: basil, parmesan, romano, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt, pepper");
  console.log("Pulse basil and pine nuts");
  console.log("Add garlic and cheeses");
  console.log("Slowly pour in oil");
  console.log("Season");
}

makeFreshPesto();
// I spelled out function, added a space in line 29 between the end parantheses and the curly brace, then I moved the end curly bracket down to line 35 to follow format.

//  EX 4:
function average(num1, num2) {
  var sum = num1 + num2;
  var avg = sum / 2;
  console.log(`the average is: ${avg}.`);
  }

average (4, 10);
// I moved the opening curly bracket to line 41 , then I tabbed the var in line 42 and 43, then I moved the console log up a line and added a semi colon, I moved the period inside the back tick, and added a call function.
